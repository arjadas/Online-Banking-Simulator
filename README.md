## Development
Install dependencies
```sh
npm install
```
or
```sh
npm i
```

Generate types for the Cloudflare bindings in `wrangler.toml`:
```sh
npm run typegen
```
or
```sh
npx wrangler types
```
You will need to rerun typegen whenever you make changes to `wrangler.toml`.

Generate types the Prisma schema:
```sh
npx prisma generate
```
You will need to rerun this whenever you make changes to `prisma/schema.prisma`. You will also need to run migration commands, please see the Prisma documentation for this, however here are some examples:
```sh
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply learn-to-bank --local
```
```sh
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply learn-to-bank --remote
```
```sh
npx prisma migrate diff --from-local-d1 --to-schema-datamodel ./prisma/schema.prisma --script --output migrations/0004.sql
```
```sh
npx prisma migrate diff --from-empty --to-schema-datamodel ./prisma/schema.prisma --script > migrations/0004.sql
```
These commands should be run in the module currently being worked on - e.g.

```sh
cd learn-to-bank
``` 

## Deployment
This is the command to deploy all modules from the CLI.
```sh
npm run deploy
```
However, automatic deployment can be made possible through the GitHub actions that have been set up. Deployment is also possible through the Cloudflare dashboard. Please see the Cloudflare docs to set up a Cloudflare account, and how to create all the required Cloudflare products. This can be done through the Cloudflare dashboard or CLI. Assigning yourself as an admin is possible either through the Cloudflare dashboard or the admin console that has been built. A checkbox to bypass the admin RBAC has been constructed, this will need to be removed before deployment to production.
