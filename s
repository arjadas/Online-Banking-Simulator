Hey guys, so I've worked on the app a bit and honestly I think the hard part is all done. Sorry to introduce yet another framework but I've switched from RedwoodJs to Remix, mainly because Redwood had so many bugs (I even reported this one https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/issues/11464 I kinda felt embarrassed for them ngl for a popular framework lol), but also Remix is so much simpler. If you overhear other groups talk about NextJs this is a similar framework, that is it uses server-side rendering (which eliminates the need to use a graphql API, and heavily relying on Redux), but also uses nested routes. See remix.run and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4B69HAOXnA pls, and the draft diagram of the new setup. You can also get extensions for remix in vscode. Firebase Authentication is all set up and I've implemented transferring between accounts. Also, please install Docker and pgAdmin to get the database up and running (and use docker-compose up --build). The main app hasn't been dockerized properly yet, but you can use Vite (by running npm run dev) for development. I think we'll use Neon for database deployment and Render to deploy the Remix app, but for now it's all local. Also, I've said that using Builder.io on the Figma to generate the Ui comes out bad, but its actually hit or miss. It worked well with the accounts page but not the transfer page for example. (I then ran each through chatGPT/Claude asking it to rebuild it with Geist components). Lets have an in-person meeting soon guys (for all that can make it). I'd rather explain all this, answer questions in person and help set it up if you run into trouble in person, I think I'd have a hard time doing it over zoom/text lol. Also don't mean to impose but from here on in please run any big changes or new libraries by me thanks.
